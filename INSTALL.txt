Instructions:

First, make sure you have the graphics library installed on your computer. You can install graphics by using the "opam install graphics" command in terminal. 

If this command doesn't work, you may not have pkgconfig installed. To install this, do the following:

    If you have macports, use "sudo port install pkgconfig"

    If you have homebrew, use "brew install pkg-config"

Also make sure you have XQuartz installed and running.

Next, download the release code from our CMS submission. It is a ZIP file.

Now you need to extract the ZIP file. Do this from the terminal, not from a graphical interface. Run "unzip tetrisgame.zip" from the directory containing the ZIP file. That will create a subdirectory tetrisgame with the release code. Now cd into that directory.

Next, run "make build" in the terminal.

After the file is successfully built, run "make" in the terminal.

This should open a window that displays a welcome screen with a message and the tetris pieces that we created. You can also click on the window to view the game screen that we created.
